# SQL EDA & Data Analytics Project

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data analytics. The queries are designed to help analyze, summarize, and interpret data stored in a relational database.

The project demonstrates practical SQL techniques used by data analysts and BI professionals to uncover insights, evaluate performance, and support data-driven decision-making.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project Overview

The SQL scripts in this repository cover a wide range of analytical use cases, including:

Database and data structure exploration

Aggregated measures and key metrics

Time-based trend analysis and seasonality

Cumulative and running calculations

Ranking and performance analysis

Customer and product segmentation

Regional and category-level comparisons

Each query focuses on a specific analytical objective and follows clear, readable, and optimized SQL practices.

# Skills & Concepts Used

SQL aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD)

Time-series analysis

Cumulative metrics

Subqueries and CTEs

Data filtering and segmentation

Analytical comparisons across dimensions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose

This project is intended to:

Demonstrate practical SQL analytics skills

Serve as a reference for common EDA patterns

Showcase real-world analytical query design

Support learning and interview preparation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dataset

The analysis is performed on a transactional-style dataset containing information such as:

Orders and order dates

Sales and profit metrics

Products and categories

Customers and regions
